#LazyFlickr---------LazyFlickr is a sample Android application that shows images from Flickr based on a location feed.  The application utilizes a Lazy Loading technique that also caches data to the device's SD card for later retrieval.![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qtX2J17JmUY/UKSIqFa6GrI/AAAAAAAAD-8/jzT-44fT30s/s800/Screenshot_2012-11-15-01-15-01.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qtX2J17JmUY/UKSIqFa6GrI/AAAAAAAAD-8/jzT-44fT30s/s800/Screenshot_2012-11-15-01-15-01.png)## Proposed Feature Set---------Display a scrolling list of images loaded from [http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=boston](http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=boston).  Asynchronously load the photos if they're not in the cache, add them to the cache, and make them available for display.  The cache should be on disk so that the photos are available in the future launches of the application. - Preferences: set the cache size limit - Preferences: clear cache - Logic: clear cache as well if the ones in cache aren't within the first __# - Click image for big view - Set source (potential) - Option to Prefetch larger image views## TODO--------- - Setup SD card save location - Parse XML or JSON from HTTP - Implement LazyLoader - Implement Adapter (don't need a cursor, that is for contacts, calendars, etc) - Implement stub loading image - Bind Adapter - UI Tweaks### Flickr API Key**LazyFlickr**  **Key**  88b3f7ed9b982399d79898d96ec2bd0c  **Secret**  342a594b4262f79a

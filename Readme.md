#LazyFlickrLazyFlickr is a sample Android application that shows images from Flickr based on a location feed.  The application utilizes a Lazy Loading technique that also caches data to the device's SD card for later retrieval.![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pTDD9EYl8V4/UKfv4Zmm7VI/AAAAAAAAD_M/PvhsWkn7V6Y/s512/Screenshot_2012-11-16-01-22-53.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pTDD9EYl8V4/UKfv4Zmm7VI/AAAAAAAAD_M/PvhsWkn7V6Y/s512/Screenshot_2012-11-16-01-22-53.png)## Proposed Feature SetDisplay a scrolling list of images loaded from [http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=boston](http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=boston).  Asynchronously load the photos if they're not in the cache, add them to the cache, and make them available for display.  The cache should be on disk so that the photos are available in the future launches of the application.## TODO - UI Tweaks     - Make the stub image and thumbnail image the same size     - Hide the refresh button during refresh.  This requires ActionBarCompatability or ActionBarSherlock - Option to Prefetch larger image views - Click image for big view - Logic: clear cache as well if the ones in cache aren't within the first __# - Preferences: set the cache size limit - Preferences: clear cache

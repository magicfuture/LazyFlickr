#LazyFlickrLazyFlickr is a sample Android application that shows images from Flickr based on a location feed.  The application utilizes a Lazy Loading technique that also caches data to the device's SD card for later retrieval.![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fyOqXAwjGOI/UKh80St1A-I/AAAAAAAAD_c/Asjegl2WAdg/s512/Screenshot_2012-11-18-01-04-36.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fyOqXAwjGOI/UKh80St1A-I/AAAAAAAAD_c/Asjegl2WAdg/s512/Screenshot_2012-11-18-01-04-36.png)## Proposed Feature SetDisplay a scrolling list of images loaded from [http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=boston](http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=boston).  Asynchronously load the photos if they're not in the cache, add them to the cache, and make them available for display.  The cache should be on disk so that the photos are available in the future launches of the application.## Notable Features - Full offline support for feed data and image data - Asynchronous, Crossfading image transitions upon image load - A gallery implementation using ViewPager - Actionbar implemented using ActionBarSherlock ## TODO - Finish the refresh button spin logic - Logic: clear cache as well if the ones in cache aren't within the first __# - Preferences: set the cache size limit - Preferences: clear cache - Preferences: Prefetch large images - Apply a small ~5px dark grey border around thumbnail images - Make the empty listview a text input with a go button to load flickr data from a tag.    - Prepopulate with 'Boston'    - Make an actionbar icon to bring up this same tag input UI - Large images will crossfade to blank with internet off - Order entries in reverse (insert at beginning) or sort by date
